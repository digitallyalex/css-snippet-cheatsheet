## Deployed Application Link
https://digitallyalex.github.io/css-snippet-cheatsheet/

## Description
This is a mini site that keeps CSS code snippets for easy access for bootcap students and junior web developers.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
This site was designed to be responsive and simple to access on both mobile and desktop, and to allow easy copying of the code snippets.

As users hover over the needed snippet of code, the code box will be highlighted with a special effect for ease of orientation.

## Credits
Overall instruction and provision of necessary materials for this project from the EdX Front-End Web Development Bootcamp instructor and teaching assistants (Oct2023 Cohort), as well as my EdX tutor.
